Letting an app read your keystrokes can be risky (though we are not doing anything with Abnormal Mouse). Turn it on if you want to use keyboard keys as activators. It will also slightly increase CPU usage when idel. \n\nYou can use tools like ReiKey to check if the app is still listening to your keystrokes";
